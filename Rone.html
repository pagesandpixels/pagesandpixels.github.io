        <h2>Reviewing the Second Season and the Shocking Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
          Netflix has been known for cancelling fan-favourite shows in the past and seeming to lack all reason to do so, but near the end of 2023, a certain cancellation particularly enraged fans of a favourite book-to-screen adaptation.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Netflix original series, <i>Shadow and Bone</i> became hugely popular when the first season released in 2021. Based on Leigh Bardugos’ famous <i>Grishaverse</i> books, the show combined characters and plots from both the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> and <i>Six of Crows</i> series. <i>Shadow and Bone Season 2</i>, releasing in the summer of 2023 combined the second and third books of the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> series: <i>Siege and Storm</i> and <i>Ruin and Rising</i>. Alongside this, the “crows” were given a plot that supported the main characters whilst going through some of the motions of <i>Six of Crows’</i> sequel, <i>Crooked Kingdom</i>. 
        </p>
        <p>
        What seems to upset fans most, including myself, is that we did not get to see the crows’ famous “Ice Court Heist,” a heist involving lots of character bonding, action and hilarity which is the main plot of <i>Six of Crows</i>. If the show was renewed for a third season, there was likely to be a <i>Six of Crows</i> spin-off too where this heist could take place without distractions from the other plots. Since this spin-off is of course no longer happening, I cannot help but feel that the amazing cast of crows should have been given better plots (like the “Ice Court Heist”) since I feel the alternative storylines created for them did not give them enough of a chance. In the second season, I found it a bit irritating and unnecessary how the events took place so out of order compared to the books, using moments of significant character development too early-on, therefore losing some of their impact. In addition, some major scenes were cut from <i>Siege and Storm</i> and <i>Ruin and Rising</i>, often combining scenes from both books into one. I understand their need to stick to their number of 8-episodes per season but this repackaging of events decreased the overall drama in some instances. I am also curious at the reasons for combining both books into one season in the first place, as though they guessed that Netflix would cancel them from the start and wanted to pack in as much as they could. 
         </p>
        
        <p>
        But don’t get me wrong. Despite these criticisms, I still love the show. It had very talented actors, all who were perfectly casted to bring the book characters to life and they poured their hearts into the roles, from their comedy to emotional scenes to captivating stunts. It also had great special-effects, sets and costumes to make the magical world feel like a real place. Also, everyone knows that the show had huge popularity so the reason for cancelling it has remained confusing. Fans, including myself, were heartbroken after seeing multiple cast members speak on the cancellation on their social media. I was simply in shock that we would not get to see this cast continue on in their roles which they were so well suited to play, especially as the actors are such close friends in real life, giving fans plenty of adorable and hilarious interactions to watch. 
         </p>
        
        <p>
        That being said, the <i>Grishaverse</i> fandom is not backing down just yet.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I became a part of the online <i>Grishaverse</i> fandom in 2022 when I read both book series and watched the first season of the Netflix show. This fandom, with all of its memes and headcanons, spreads love for both the fictional characters and actors who play them. It was so much fun to be a part of and is also one of the biggest fandoms of YA books ever. That is why we are not accepting the cancellation as final.
        </p>
        <p>
        The “Save Shadow and Bone” petition has become one of the most signed petitions on Change. Org, amassing nearly 200,000 signatures as of January, 2024. The petition has also combined forces with another devastatingly cancelled book-to-screen adaptation, <i>Lockwood and Co</i>. The first and only season of <i>Lockwood and Co</i> released on Netflix early in 2023 and despite not having read the books, I instantly fell in love with the characters and the spooky, but comforting vibe of the world they lived in. I know the show was also very popular and supported by fans, making the cancellation almost equally as shocking as <i>Shadow and Bone’s</i>. The idea for the combined fandoms is that we answer Netflix’s questionnaires, suggesting that both series be renewed. And if this kind of support continues to back up both shows, who knows? Maybe it’s not the end. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Well, until we hear anything, or even if these series truly are over, I will say that I am thankful for all of the work put into the shows which brought me so much comfort and joy in my low moments. Fantasy books and TV shows like these are a special place for me and I am glad so many people have come together to create these productions for us to enjoy. Let’s keep hoping, and to my fellow <i>Six of Crows</i> readers,

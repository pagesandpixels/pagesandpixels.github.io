    <p> WHY DID YOU DROP OUT OF YALE asks Jess Mariano, Rory’s ex-boyfriend. </p>
 <p>I ask myself the same thing Rory. </p>
 <p>This happens in season 6 of Gilmore Girls, a highly acclaimed drama set in small town Connecticut, Stars Hollow, the show that pulled on everyone's heart strings, comforting us through our screens. </p>
 <p>Why would you spend your whole life trying to get into an Ivy league school and once you get there, drop out? </p>
 <p>One of Rory's defining traits early on is her academic prowess. She attends Chilton, an elite preparatory school, and later pursues her education at Yale University. Her dedication to her studies and the pursuit of her dreams makes her a role model for many viewers. </p>
 <p>The Rory of the first few seasons was the one we aspired to be. A studious, book lover, fashionably dressed, funny girl with a fabulous re!ationship with her mother. Something we all can’t relate to but find comfort in. </p>
 <p>However, her journey takes a turn as the series progresses. </p>
 <p>The decline in Rory's character becomes evident as she navigates the challenges of adulthood. Her romantic relationships become more complex (stringing someone along is not okay. Cheating is not okay. no matter if you're the cheater or accomplice to someone else's cheating), and her professional aspirations face setbacks. The once-driven and focused Rory begins to lose her sense of direction. </p>
 <p>Rory's romantic entanglements, notably with Logan Huntzberger, play a significant role in her character's decline. The choices she makes in her relationships contribute to a sense of inconsistency and frustration among fans who had initially admired her stability. </p>
 <p>One of the reasons for this frustration is her dropping out of her ivy league education she spent all of her life working up to. </p>
 <p>As much as we liked Logan, they didn’t always make the best choices together, that’s for sure. </p>
 <p>Though, Logan loved her, truly and when in season 7, the last one, at her graduation (thank the coffee gods, she went back) he asks her to marry him and…SHE. SAYS. NO. </p>
 <p>THE END. </p>
 <p>but wait…what about the weird reboot thing they did. </p>
 <p>They must’ve given us closure, right? </p>
 <p>Long story short…no, not at all, not when Rory is not only an accomplice to cheating this time but also a cheater herself. Oh and let’s not forget the last words of the show. “I’m pregnant, Mom”
    </p>
